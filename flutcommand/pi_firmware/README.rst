Install latest raspbian, enable camera, configure for headless (set resolution), configure network, install chromium.

Maybe you want to configure some sort of vnc access.

copy over bot.py (edit, change UDP_IP) and run it

In X, start chromium pointing to a jisti room. Room settings: "all join with cam and mic off, everyone follows me"
